/**
 * Flow 4: Delete a payment → disappears from list
 * Risk: DELETE API succeeds but UI retains the stale row — user thinks payment
 *       still exists and count never decrements.
 * Real boundaries: auth, DELETE /bills/payments/:id, UI list re-render.
 * Each test uses a fresh isolated user → exactly one payment row on the page.
