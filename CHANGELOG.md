## v1.1.0 — 27-09-2026

### Features

- Per-user editable categories: create, rename, recolor, and archive categories, with backup/restore support
- Telegram reminders per user; email reminders now sent via Apprise. All notifications are off by default for new users
- Selective backup: choose which sections to export, and restore them partially
- Delete account, with full data cascade
- Default currency preference (plus CNY support)
- Interface languages: Spanish, Italian, French and Chinese added; choose which languages appear in the switcher
- Settings page regrouped into tabs (Account, Preferences, Notifications, Categories, Data), with the active tab kept in
  the URL
- Filters on Payments, Bills, and Archive views (multi-select category and status), plus category & status sorting
- Collapsible calendar view on Payments, marking days that have bills due
- "Mark as Paid" now includes a payment date field, and reverting a payment asks for confirmation
- Archived bills can be restored
- Archived categories are now flagged in filters and group headers instead of silently disappearing
- Show/hide toggle on password fields
- Recurring bills can now have an end month, so installments and fixed-term contracts stop generating payments and
  reminders after the last one
- Custom repeat interval: bills can repeat every 1–12 months or every 1–5 years (e.g. every 4 months, every 2 years).
  Existing "Every 2 months" and "Quarterly" bills were converted automatically with the same schedule, and older backups
  still import
