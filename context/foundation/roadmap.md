# Roadmap: Pay Tracker

> Derived from `context/foundation/prd.md`. Edit-in-place. Full per-change history (decisions, pitfalls) lives in `context/archive/history.md`.
> `/10x-archive` closes items by exact `Change ID` (flips Status in the table below and appends to `## Done`).

## Vision recap

Pay Tracker replaces the household spreadsheet with a self-hostable web app: recurring payment instances are generated automatically, the dashboard shows what is upcoming, overdue and paid, and each family member has an isolated account. No subscription, no third-party data sharing.

| S-20 | apprise-smtp | Email delivery via Apprise (mailto://) instead of smtplib | done |
| S-21 | telegram-notifications | Telegram reminders + monthly summary via Apprise, per-user chat id | done |
| S-22 | selective-backup | Choose backup sections (bills, categories, email, Telegram, languages, currency); restore applies what the file contains | done |

Work shipped after this roadmap was last extended (per-user categories, currencies, extra languages, delete account, calendar view, demo image, e2e suite, CI/release pipeline) was done directly and is recorded in the PRD (FR-023+) and `archive/history.md`. New slices: add rows above using the same columns.

## Open Roadmap Questions

1. **Local-mode PWA and HTTPS** — self-hosted deployment without HTTPS cannot install as a PWA on most browsers; needs a reverse-proxy/certificate note in deployment docs. Not blocking.

## Parked

- **Budgeting and savings goals** — PRD non-goal.
- **Bank / card integrations** — PRD non-goal; no automatic transaction import.
- **Multi-household / SaaS mode** — PRD non-goal; one household per deployment.
- **Native mobile app** — PRD non-goal; PWA is the mobile story.

## Done

All items in the table above are done; details in `context/archive/history.md`.
